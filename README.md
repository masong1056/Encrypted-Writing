# Encrypted Writing
Want to hide/encrypt your writing? Download my small app **Encrypted Writing!**

Encrypted Writing uses the Caesar Cipher (Shift 7) to remap your letter keys to the corresponding ciphered letter. It only changes the letters when it's lowercase or uppercase, allowing you to use your modifier keys still. 

The app comes with a **Text Encoder/Decoder**, allowing you to type or paste text into decode or encode the Caesar Cipher to reveal or conceal the text.

The Windows version is hopefully coming soon!
